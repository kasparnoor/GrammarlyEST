In linguistics, morphology is the study of words, how they are formed,
and their relationship to other words in the same language.
It analyzes the structure of words and parts of words such as
stems, root words, prefixes, and suffixes.  

# Examples of morphological mistakes:

* Ma armastan oma **pere**. -> Ma armastan oma **peret**.

* Ma oled **tark**. -> **Ma olen** tark./**Sa oled** tark.

# How we will make synthetic morphological grammar mistakes

1. We take a random word and get its base form using estlnk
2. We get all the other possible word forms
3. Choose a random one (that does not make sense in the sentence)
